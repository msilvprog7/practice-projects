# Go tutorial

<https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started>

In the getting started tutorial, you learn how to setup
go and some fundamentals about go packages. The `go.mod`
file is first setup, and then tidied as dependencies
are added. It can help to redirect local packages
before each has been published. Each package can be
tested as well, then built and installed to the local
directory.

Next, I'll go through the Tour of Go to learn more
about the language's features.
